# Continual Learning Naive Strategies on Permuted and Split MNIST

In this brief demo we will showcase two common Continual Learning benchmark often used to introduce the problem and start prototyping possible computational strategies to solve it.

To introduce the concept of various task introduced at different time steps, we used the following two approches:
